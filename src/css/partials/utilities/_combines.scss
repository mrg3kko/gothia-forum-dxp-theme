// This file may only have mixins which combine other mixins.
//
// Reason best described with an example:
// If we repeatedly want to change the color of headings, paragraph text and
// links; Instead of writing 3 lines, we merge them together to 1 mixin 
// such as this:
//
// @mixin comb-color-negative {
// 		@include headings-negative();
// 		@include paragraph-negative();
// 		@include links-negative();
// }
//
// Namespace all combines with 'comb-', e.g. '@mixin comb-color-negative'.

@mixin comb-color-negative {
	@include headings-negative();
	@include paragraph-negative();
	@include links-negative();
}
